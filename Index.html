        <h1>J-Ratings</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        A simple site to allow some of my friends to see their ratings updated <b>quickly</b>.
        <p> 
        I will update every Sunday evening so you will have these ratings updated reliably.
        If however I am free on a certain evening I may update more than once a week.
        <br><br>
        You don't need to update me on your results. I should be able to
        find the results quite easily on my own. Update me if I've made a mistake or missed 
        a game.
