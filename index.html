        <h1>J-Ratings</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        A simple site to allow some of my friends to see their ratings updated.
        <p> 
        I will commit to updating no longer than once every 7 days but ideally 
        more frequently.
        <br><br>
        You don't need to update me on your results. I should be able to
        find the results quite easily on my own. Update me if I've made a mistake or missed 
        a game.
        <br><br>
        An added benfit of this site is the fact the graph doesn't reset every 6-months. 
        Rather, the data continues on the same graph but in a different colour so you can better see your progress.
